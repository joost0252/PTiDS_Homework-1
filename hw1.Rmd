Moreover, record a short video to introduce your group and include it in your RMarkdown document.

1. An avatar picture. Make sure to include a caption for this image. Make sure all pictures have the same size.

2. A paragraph describing your favorite hobby as well as one interesting fact about yourself (preferably true).
Your favorite quote in blockquote format. Make sure to reference your quote using BibTex.

3. A table having two columns (first column containing the classes you are following this semester; second column containing the time of these classes).

4.Add at least one emoji and one Giphy per group member.
